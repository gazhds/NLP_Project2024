# About 
In this repository you can find our code work for the project in Natural Languages Processing and Deep Learning in the IT University of Copenhagen.

The notebook model_train.ipynb was used to train the model and save it to the HuggingFace hub. As a starting point in the code we used the functions and resources in HuggingFace's NLP course.

Then the model can be loaded to make predictions in load_model.ipynb. Code can be run like a regular Jupyter notebook and has instructions on how to load different models and make a prediction with them.

Perturbations to the data were made with code in introducing_noise.ipynb and plots used in the report are from Analysis_results.ipynb.
